# Example Home Assistant configuration for River Height sensor
# Place this in your Home Assistant configuration.yaml file

# Basic River Height Sensor Configuration (single sensor with attributes)
# River Height Sensor Configuration
sensor:
  - platform: river_height
    url: "ftp://ftp.bom.gov.au/anon/gen/fwo/IDQ60005.html"
    name: "Coomera River"
    unit_of_measurement: "m"
    station_filter: "Coomera R at Oxenford Weir"
    create_additional_sensors: true

# Advanced example with multiple separate sensors for each field
# sensor:
#   - platform: river_height
#     url: "ftp://ftp.bom.gov.au/anon/gen/fwo/IDQ60005.html" 
#     name: "Coomera River"
#     unit_of_measurement: "m"
#     station_filter: "Coomera R at Oxenford Weir"
#     create_additional_sensors: true
#     # Optional: customize the update interval (default is 30 minutes)
#     scan_interval: 00:30:00
#
# This will create the following sensors:
# - sensor.coomera_river (the height value)
# - sensor.coomera_river_station (station name)
# - sensor.coomera_river_last_updated (timestamp)
# - sensor.coomera_river_trend (rising/falling/steady)
# - sensor.coomera_river_status (status information)
